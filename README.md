This example demonstrates a subtle error in COBOL related to 88-level conditionals.  The code snippet showcases how an 88 level item is declared but never explicitly set to a value, which can lead to unpredictable program behavior.  This is an uncommon error because it's not a syntax error, but a logical error that is hard to find.  The solution shows how to correctly set the 88-level item to ensure proper program flow.
